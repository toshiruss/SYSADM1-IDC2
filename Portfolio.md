**Course Reflection**

> What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course
> meet, exceed, or fall short of these expectations?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > I initially expected the course to cover basic system               |
| > administration topics like server management, service               |
| > configuration, and IT infrastructure fundamentals. However, the     |
| > course went beyond my expectations by delving into advanced areas   |
| > such as network configuration, user authentication, automation, and |
| > practical troubleshooting, providing a well-rounded learning        |
| > experience.                                                         |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
> these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > The course explored essential topics like file system management,   |
| > service operations on Linux and Windows, physical and network       |
| > infrastructure, and user authentication using Kerberos. It also     |
| > emphasized the use of tools like GitHub for teamwork and version    |
| > control. These areas provided a solid understanding of system\      |
| > administration by combining theoretical concepts with practical     |
| > applications, preparing me to handle real-world IT challenges       |
| > effectively.                                                        |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
> strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
> material?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > Engaging in hands-on tasks, such as setting up virtual machines,    |
| > configuring services, and troubleshooting systems, proved to be the |
| > most effective strategy for learning. Regular practice, maintaining |
| > detailed notes, and collaborating with peers on group projects      |
| > helped reinforce my understanding. Using GitHub for project         |
| > management also enhanced my ability to learn and work efficiently   |
| > in a team environment.                                              |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
> significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
> effective?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > Assignments related to configuring services, setting up networks,   |
| > and managing file systems were highly beneficial. Projects that     |
| > involved scripting and leveraging GitHub for version control were   |
| > especially impactful because they closely resembled tasks performed |
| > in real-world system administration roles, making the learning      |
| > process practical and meaningful.                                   |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course?
> How did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from
> them?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > One major challenge was understanding and implementing complex      |
| > configurations, such as secure\                                     |
| > authentication systems and network services. I overcame these       |
| > difficulties by seeking guidance from additional resources,         |
| > practicing in virtual environments, and consulting with instructors |
| > and classmates. This experience taught me resilience,               |
| > problem-solving, and the importance of seeking support when needed. |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it
> promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or
> decision-making?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > The course promoted critical thinking by presenting real-world      |
| > problems that required analyzing situations, identifying solutions, |
| > and executing them effectively. Tasks such as troubleshooting       |
| > system errors and optimizing server performance encouraged          |
| > higher-order thinking by requiring a logical and systematic         |
| > approach to problem-solving and decision-making.                    |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or
> perspectives did you gain from this course?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > I gained valuable technical skills in system administration,        |
| > including managing files and services,\                             |
| > troubleshooting networks, and securing systems. I also developed a  |
| > better appreciation for structured workflows, thorough              |
| > documentation, and teamwork, particularly through the use of        |
| > GitHub. These experiences gave me a clearer perspective on the      |
| > importance of system administrators in maintaining reliable IT      |
| > operations.                                                         |
