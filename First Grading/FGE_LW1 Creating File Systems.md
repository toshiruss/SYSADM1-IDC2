12. **Check file properties:** Right-click on the \"info.txt\" file and

    read-only status.

> **The creation date of the file depends on the time that it was
> created. Also, the size of the file depends on how many characters are
> inside the file. A read-only status on a.txt file means you can open
> and view the file but cannot make any changes to it. The difference
> between the General and Details tabs is that the detail tab has more
> specific data about the file, like the owner and the name of the
> computer.**

13. **Change file attributes:** Try changing the file attributes (e.g.,
    read-only, hidden) using the Properties dialog. Observe the changes
    in File Explorer.

> **When I click the hidden attribute, the file will vanish and if I
> click the read-only attribute, the file will restore.**

14. **Share the folder:** Right-click on the \"Lab1_Windows\" folder,
    select \"Properties,\" and then the \"Sharing\" tab. Share the
    folder with a specific user or group, setting appropriate
    permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Full control)

15. **Create an archive:** Use WinRAR or 7-Zip to create a compressed
    archive of the \"Lab1_Windows\" folder.
